Guide: Generating a Supabase Migration from an Existing Remote Database
This document outlines the complete process followed to set up the Supabase CLI on Windows, connect it to a remote project, and generate an initial migration file that matches the remote database schema. It includes the errors encountered and their solutions.

Step 1: Installing the Supabase CLI using Scoop on Windows
The first step was to install the Supabase Command Line Interface (CLI). We used the Scoop package manager for Windows.

Enable PowerShell Scripts & Install Scoop:

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser; Invoke-RestMethod -Uri [https://get.scoop.sh](https://get.scoop.sh) | Invoke-Expression

Add the Supabase Bucket: This tells Scoop where to find the Supabase CLI package.

scoop bucket add supabase [https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git](https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git)

Install the Supabase CLI:

scoop install supabase

Verify the Installation: We confirmed the CLI was installed and accessible in the terminal by checking its version.

supabase --version
# Expected Output: 2.39.2

Step 2: Initializing the Local Project and Linking to Supabase
With the CLI installed, the next step was to configure a local project directory and link it to the live Supabase project.

Initialize the Local Project: This command creates the supabase configuration folder in the current directory.

supabase init

Attempt to Link the Project (Error): The first attempt to link failed because the CLI was not authenticated.

supabase link --project-ref smpdbqzvgwgwdyxwvrzz
# Error: Access token not provided.

Log In to Supabase: The solution was to run the login command, which opened a browser for authentication.

supabase login
# After authentication in the browser, a token was provided.

Link the Project (Success): With the CLI authenticated, the linking process was successful.

supabase link --project-ref smpdbqzvgwgwdyxwvrzz

Note: A warning was shown about the local database version. This was fixed by editing the supabase/config.toml file and adding [db] \n major_version = 15.
